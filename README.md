Dating problem with Diffie-Hellman (With fundamental fatal defect).

Dating problem is a cryptograpy question.
The idea is essentially to securely compute an AND function.
See the following paper for more information about the problem:
http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/personal/st/S.Schneider/papers/2011/cryptoforma11a.pdf

This short program is a proposed implementation (with fatal defect however) of the problem using the hardness of computational Diffie-Hellman problem.
One running instance can be found in: http://www.haochenwu.com/dhdating/dhdating.html

//TODO: Add more description.
